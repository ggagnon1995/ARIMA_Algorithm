# ARIMA_Algorithm
[Work in progress] An ARIMA Algorithm that loops through parameters and chooses the optimal model

# What's next: 
- Fix up the final data frame to include dates previous to the out of sample forecast
- Alter functions to loop through different stock prices and create several frames
- Validate the model with a train test split 
- Produce graphs
